        <h3><u>This page explains the basics of the GitHub workflow.</u></h3>
        <h4><u>What is a commit?</u></h4>
        
        <p> When changes are made to a file and added to a branch, this is a commit. 
            Using commits is useful as it helps to keep track of changes made and the progress of a branch. 
            Using commits means it is easy to look back and see what has been done, making it easier for others to 
            understand the process - this is particularly useful for team working! Commits also make it easier to see where 
            errors or bugs may have occured.</p>
            <p>Note - the commit message makes a note of what changes have been made and why they were made.</p>
            
            <h4><u>What is a branch?</h4></u>
                <p>Branches are a way of seperating ideas from the main branch of a project. 
                    New branches are places where new ideas can be tested without affecting the main branch until
                    you (and your team) are happy with it. </p>
                    <p>Note - branch names should be clear and descriptive!</p>

                    <h4><u>What is a pull request?</h4></u>
                        <p> A pull request allows other members of the team to see your code before it is added to the 
                            main branch, they can also provide advice or offer suggestions for changes.</p>
                    <p>Note - pull requests can be used at any time whilst working on an aspect of your project, not just when it's finished.</p>

                <h4><u>Additonal information:</u></h4>
                        <p><b> Below is a visual guide to the GitHub worflow (taken from the GitHub guides website):</b></p>

                            <p>I personally struggled with some of the concepts above initially because I didn't fully understand 'Git' and 'GitHub'. 
                                    I found videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkFiqHnNaxpOPhh9tSWMXIF">FreeCodeCamp Youtube Channel</a> really helpful in 
                                    solidifying my understanding of the concepts, maybe you will too. </p>
